The [Malawi Spatial Data Platform](http://www.masdap.mw) (MASDAP) is a data sharing tool launched in November 2012, managed by the Malawi National Spatial Data Center (in the Department of Surveys), in collaboration with the National Statistics Office and a number of technical Ministries. It is based on GeoNode and will create a platform for improved inter-agency information collaboration and enhanced public access for awareness-building, research, further knowledge product creation and decision support.

A substantial amount of data has already been collated, and it is envisioned that in the near future, MASDAP will include further information and visualization to the platform from various global and in-country sources, expanding institutional commitments to open data, supporting community mapping activities, and developing decision support tools that leverage open data to assist the Government of Malawi with contingency and land-use planning activities.

MASDAP is receiving start-up support through the World Bank DRM program under the Open Data for Resilience Initiative. ITHACA is currently developing [a new version of MASDAP](http://masdap.ithacaweb.org) including a redesigned UX/UI, OpenStreetMap daily extracts of Malawi and a CMS integration.
