The European Commission's Copernicus Emergency Management Service (Copernicus EMS) provides information for emergency response in relation to different types of disasters, including meteorological hazards, geophysical hazards, deliberate and accidental man-made disasters and other humanitarian disasters as well as prevention, preparedness, response and recovery activities.

The spatial data produced by the service is released to public in real time while the emergency activation is ongoing. In emergency situations is necessary to have fast, reliable and efficient systems able to provide  damage data as well as their context to the end user. The JRC is using GeoNode based systems to share such information with the stakeholders and the broad public relying on advanced caching mechanisms based on Mapproxy managed by GeoNode and custom django apps, also released as open source software.

A first beta version of the system is on line ([ActivationViewer](http://viewer.copernicus-ems.eu/)) based on GeoNode 2.4 using a custom Angular.js client while a new version based on React.js and the new Boundless-sdk is under development.
