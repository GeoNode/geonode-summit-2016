[InaSAFE](http://inasafe.org) is a QGIS plugin that helps disaster managers plan for disasters. Although InaSAFE runs on the QGIS desktop environment, the same core code base can be deployed in other context whilst still making use of the QGIS libraries. In this session we will explain how we went about deploying a QGIS plugin in GeoNode and some of the design considerations that were required in the process.
