Extensive capabilities and potential customizations of the GeoNode are highlighted on the Afghanistan Spatial Data Center (ASDC), the principal geospatial information platform in Afghanistan. The ASDC is used daily by the humanitarian community for emergency response, forecasting, M&E and planning purposes.  

Capabilities include:

* Forecasting (including estimates on population at risk for each of the following):
  * Every hour the Flash Flood Risk is estimated valid for the next 6 hours
  * Every 6 hours the river flood risk is estimated for the next 4 days
  * Every day the snow cover and snow depth is estimated
  * Once a day the avalanche risk based on snow cover and depth is assessed
  * Earthquake data is being monitored every 5 minutes
  * +5M Earthquakes estimates on population shake intensity (approx. 1 1/2 hours after event)
* Map statistics & Dashboard:
  * Flood risk areas and population/landcover type at risk
  * Avalanche risk areas and population at risk
  * Humanitarian Access for entire Afghanistan, incidents mapped daily
  * GSM coverage
  * Accessibility. Travel time and distance between points of interest:
* User tracking, printing capabilities A1-A4
