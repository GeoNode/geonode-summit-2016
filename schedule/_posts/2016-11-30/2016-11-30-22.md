QGIS is probably the most popular and well known Free and Open Source Desktop
GIS. Perhaps less well know is the fact that there is also an OGC Server
implementation based on the same libraries called QGIS Server. Kartoza was
funded by WorldBank/GFDRR to add support for using the QGIS Server backend as
an alternative to GeoServer. The advantage of this approach is that users can
define layer cartography on their desktops using QGIS and then publish a layer
along with its cartography to the web. In this talk we will describe how we
implemented this, as well as some of the challenges we faced and future avenues
of work we intend to do.
