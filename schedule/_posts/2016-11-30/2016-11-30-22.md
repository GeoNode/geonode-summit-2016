[QGIS](http://qgis.org) is probably the most popular and well known Free and Open Source Desktop GIS.  Perhaps less well know is the fact that there is also an OGC Server implementation based on the same libraries called QGIS Server.  [Kartoza](http://kartoza.com) was funded by WorldBank/GFDRR to add support for using the QGIS Server backend as a drop in replacement for GeoServer. The advantage of this approach is that users can define layer cartography on their desktops using QGIS and then publish a layer along with its cartography to the web. In this talk we will describe how we implemented this, as well as some of the challenges we faced and future avenues of work we intend to do.
